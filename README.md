# headshave

(My first smart-contract project.)  Headshave allows users to pledge money towards a particular outcome.  If the outcome occurs, they donate the money.  Not unlike kickstarter.

## dependencies

  1. All dependencies listed in package.json
  2. truffle
  3. ganache

## test node

Run a fake node for testing purposes with `ganache-cli` or better yet, use `Ganache.app` where you can control and see different addresses.

## truffle

Run operations for solidity with truffle: `truffle compile`, `truffle migrate`, `truffle console`, etc.

## test

Run tests (with a watcher) with

    npm run watch
